-Indicate when a device is connected
-Send parameters when updated -> event?
    -listen for confirmation
-recieve egram data and current status

configure data frame -> 

Extra parameters
5.7.1 Maximum Sensor Rate (MSR) 


Show Egram data
-DATE FORMAT?

-option to show atrium, ventricle, or both
-fix time scale according to BAUD rate


-Activity Threshold

-Reaction Time
The reaction time is the time required for an activity to drive the rate from LRL to MSR.

-Response Factor
The highest response factor setting (16) shall allow the greatest incremental change in rate.
2. The lowest response factor setting (1) shall allow a smaller change in rate.

-Recovery Time
 The recovery time shall be the time required for the rate to fall from MSR to LRL
when activity falls below the activity threshold.
